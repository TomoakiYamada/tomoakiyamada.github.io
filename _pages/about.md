My research focuses on economic inequality dynamics in Japan, examining long-term trends and short-term fluctuations in earnings, income, consumption, and wealth distribution through dynamic economic models and microdata analysis from household surveys.

A significant portion of my work addresses Japan’s fiscal crisis through the lens of demographic change and aging populations. Using micro data-based modeling approaches, I analyze how social security systems, government debt dynamics, and labor market policies interact with demographic transitions, quantifying the fiscal burden of aging societies and evaluating potential policy responses.

I combine rigorous empirical analysis with dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) modeling to understand how structural changes in Japan’s economy—particularly in labor and financial markets—have altered the relationship between macroeconomic policies and inequality over time. This approach bridges microeconomic foundations with macroeconomic policy analysis, contributing to both academic research and policy discussions on inequality and economic stability.
